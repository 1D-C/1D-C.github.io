  <h1>Water tower</h1>
    <img src="images/Water tower.png.png" alt="Water tower" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
<p>I took this photo off the sky bridge on the 7th floor between
the west and east building and while the larger scene of the city
was certainly eye  catching for me when I chose this. The general 
scene was definitely nice on the skybridge between west and east 
on the 7th floor, but I felt more inclined to trying to get that
water tower as the main subject I would say because its technically
the first one I ever saw In person so it stood out more.</p>
