  <h1>AI slop reflection</h1>
<p>There is definitely an excess of AI use in the media as of today across many platforms such as instagram, youtube and what 
  I feel mostly on TikTok that replaces other content. Whenever I go on lets say youtube shorts because yes that's one of my 
  mainly used platforms, very good while I run into something AI generated. It's either realistic videos that defy any sense 
  \of logic and physics, clips or real life being imitated, or just cartoonish ideas on my screen. There is definitely a worry
  with these generated videos since it's just giving an AI a prompt with who knows what as a reference to make content to put
  out on social media, not to mention how it’s used in different aspects of society. AI itself is the highlight of many 
  people’s worries and fears for the future as a whole and there should be more concern into how it's used rather than the 
  existence of AI. It's something that's developing, and evolving and what we choose on how to use it shapes it. Though for 
  the general idea of how it's used, it's either the most random or semi offensive things like ice going down on a baby because 
  of their skin color showcasing the brutality of ice in a kind of funny way. 
<br><br>
And the accessibility of these AI generated content is wide, and with kids having the ability to access the internet AI 
  generated content and media is more appealing since it's able to adapt to a user's preferences. And to go further off 
  of the article says, how it “leads to the desensitisation and overwhelming of visual palates” that holds merit with 
  how our culture is shaping after all and ongoing events that no doubt have some hold on the younger generations 
  (Malik 2025). It's gotten to the point where for some there is some element of AI in the content whether it's a comparison
  to real life or just generated for quick content.AI can be used for the better especially with AI content as well. 
<br><br>
Now this does not mean that the use of it is a bad thing only those who use it in the wrong way and it has a foothold
  in technology today so it would be hard to even think of eradicating AI as a whole, better to learn in the right direction
  then not learn at all.There are some cases where AI helps people visualize ideas or concepts to the best of their degree 
  though it clearly seems that people abuse that use and make whatever they want resulting in this jumble of media as we all
  are more familiarized with AI and new technology with time. The use of it should only be used for support and guidance as 
  a whole, it is merely a stepping stone to where people want to go, not the whole path which demeans any sort of creativity
  and effort from people. If that was the case then media itself would lose meaning since it is based on human effort to 
  connect to others in some shape or form.
