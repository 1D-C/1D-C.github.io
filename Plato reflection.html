    <p>My most basic interpretation of photography is capturing a moment of something that will last for what could be forever 
      or until it's destroyed. And whenever I take a photo, that's what I usually think, that it's one moment I can go back on 
      and re-see over and over again, and the subject of it doesn't matter because I know I have secured that moment for myself 
      or for others. Many things happen within a day that sometimes it is possible you want to catch one image to preserve, and 
      I have had that habit of taking pictures from my mother. She herself has a camera that's not on her phone which she takes 
      with her on occasions with the family or if it’s a birthday though not all the time because well sometimes you want to 
      live in the moment not capture it but besides that I know she sincerely wants to capture photos of me and my family much 
      to my sometimes unwillingness to at times. For me though, while I do use photography to take pictures of people I cherish
      I also use it for the most random things: a rock I once saw, lots of background photos, maybe to have proven I was there 
      like Susan Sontag put it, and sometimes my favorite objects. Nothing like Sontag said in how it's like a gun, the 
      metaphorical replacement in taking a shot of something. <br> <br>Sometimes I go back to old photos and edit them within 
      my phone to make them clearer in a sense compared to my memory or polish it better than it seemed at the moment. And for
      image making well, besides a few creations that I have tried to make stories, ones where I try to view different 
      perspectives, nothing serious with any strong agenda. When I try to take a photo to show to others I try to show in my 
      opinion the most best version of the photo, which is basically just brightening, sharpening, or simple edits to the photo,
      besides that I try to keep it to the original before the edit because sometimes the photo in question at that moment 
      sometimes feels lackluster. Though just creating an image of my own, there is a theme I try to uphold to be a part of my 
      identity like a signature, which I try to frame as light, bright, upbeat which isn't really a full image of what I'd like
      to put when I make an image. I try to for the most part either capture photos significant to me or people close to me and
      from time to time edit them to make them seem fresher or brighter metaphorically and literally for my own comfort since I
      rarely share them on media as a whole and I do the same when I create images. It does mean keeping to a set mindset but 
      for me it's been working so far, it does make me go back to memories in a brighter image when I'm feeling nostalgic and 
      want to go down memory lane.</p>
